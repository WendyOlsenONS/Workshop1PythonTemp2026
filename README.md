# Date:  2026
**Title:  Python For All Workshop**
# Author:  Wendy Olsen - senior statistician, Office for National Statistics
Caveat: nothing in this workshop is presented by the ONS and the author, personally, takes responsibility for any errors.  The ONS doesn't control, update, or otherwise foster this series of workshops.  This particular situation is because of the rationale.
## **Rationale:**  The aim is to bring more beginners into learning Python. See Github Folder!! 
# and also encourage intermediate learners. 
You have to do so much self-training. So a lunchtime workshop is to bring us together, introduce each to others, and enable more sharing of the burdens, worries, and joys of learning this fun language, Python.
